# Carleton Schedule Creator

## Abandoned

This is my first attempt at building a web app. Django was chosen because
at the time I was very comfortable with python. A big reason for why it
wasn't done was because I didn't do sufficient research before starting,
I just jumped into the project with the most popular python framework.

Project is not finished and will not be completed. This idea was used in
a hackathon instead.
